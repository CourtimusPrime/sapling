# 🌱 Sapling

Sapling is a **chatbot conversation tree** where every message is a node that can branch, rewind, and continue independently without losing context.

> Ever have long chats with AI that gradually loses focus of the main goal? Ever discover important points that you'd like to revisit without losing your current thread?
